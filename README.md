### 2. Brief Introduction of Computer Monitor:
A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial form. A monitor usually comprises the display device, circuitry, casing, and power supply. The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) with LED backlighting having replaced cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting. Older monitors used a cathode ray tube (CRT). Monitors are connected to the computer via VGA, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), HDMI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) or other proprietary connectors and signals.

Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers were used for entertainment. From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. The common aspect ratio of televisions, and computer monitors, has changed from 4:3 to 16:10, to 16:9.

Modern computer monitors are easily interchangeable with conventional television sets. However, as computer monitors do not necessarily include components such as a television tuner and speakers, it may not be possible to use a computer monitor as a television without external components.

### 3. History

Early electronic computers were fitted with a panel of light bulbs where the state of each particular bulb would indicate the on/off state of a particular register bit inside the computer. This allowed the engineers operating the computer to monitor the internal state of the machine, so this panel of lights came to be known as the 'monitor'. As early monitors were only capable of displaying a very limited amount of information and were very transient, they were rarely considered for program output. Instead, a line printer was the primary output device, while the monitor was limited to keeping track of the program's operation.

As technology developed engineers realized that the output of a CRT display was more flexible than a panel of light bulbs and eventually, by giving control of what was displayed in the program itself, the monitor itself became a powerful output device in its own right.

Computer monitors were formerly known as visual display units (VDU), but this term had mostly fallen out of use by the 1990s.

### 4 The future of the computer monitor

Ultrawide
While bigger doesn’t always mean better, when it comes to the computer monitor, more screen is always a bonus. But the cost of ultrawide screens in the past has been prohibitive, so it was easier to set two screens side by side and connect them in such a way that they functioned as one. The market for ultrawide monitors has begun producing stunning contrast and resolution that would benefit any professional in the graphics heavy fields or photography, and the cost to purchase is becoming more viable for companies to consider.

Curves
Curved screens first became popular in the television market, not only because their graceful beauty is appealing but because they’re better suited for the single viewer. The center position is the only one to benefit from the view, making them ideal for individual office workers. With higher graphics capabilities and contrast resolution, they’re well-suited for design work, and with the curve providing more real estate than the standard monitor without being as wide as two screens side-by-side, they replace the need for multiple screens for a single employee.

4K is the Future
While televisions are becoming standard with 4K resolution, there’s been little need for them in an office setting beyond the wow factor. Unless you’re in the graphics industry, having four times the amount of pixels than a standard HD monitor hasn’t been necessary. But studies on employee well-being are showing these screens have more benefit than originally thought. The closer one sits to the screen, the higher the quality of detail. Colors are richer, blacks are deeper, and the larger amount of pixels helps reduce eye strain and fatigue. As the workplace trend toward improving employee well-being grows and the prices become more affordable, more 4K monitors will make an appearance as standard office equipment.
